Once's the file is stored in the S3 bucket we have to read and file data and store it into Operation DB
Step 1. Read the file BankCode from S3 bucket.
Step 2. Call Admin Service:-
Depending upon bankcode or bankName we have to get the file configuration for that particular bank from Admin Service.
We can get the details of file config from RECON_FILE_CONFIG table in Admin DB. These Table contains details of BANK_ID, FILE_TYPE ,FILE_DELIMETER ,FILE_HEADER_ROW , FILE_READ_FROM, FILE_ENCRYPTED etc.
Step 3. Decryption of file.
If the for the particular bankCode ,its file are encrypted then we have to first decrypt that file. And for decryption we will get key and type of encryption from RECON_FILE_CONFIG table. If file is not encrypted then we can directly move to next sept.
Step 4. Read the File details:-
Depending upon bank file we have to pars the data. Every bank have different file format and data inside the file have different format.
So to read the data we have to fellow the files config details for particular bank like from which row we will get bank id, bank Header ,ATRN details , transaction details etc.
Step 5. Store in DB:-
We have to store the read data to RECON_FILE_DTLS Table.
To store the Data  we can use Kafka that will store the data in bundle. Data are stored in particular assigned row.
Step 6. Acknowledge in s3.
Once the file is read and data is stored in DB we have to crate Acknowledge file in S3 that will keep the status of the file.

Project Story: Recon File Processing

Objective:

The purpose of this project is to automate the processing of reconciliation (Recon) files uploaded to an S3 bucket by various banks. The goal is to read, decrypt (if necessary), and parse these files, then store the parsed data in the Operations database (DB) using Kafka. Additionally, we generate an acknowledgment file in the S3 bucket after successful processing.


---

Functional Flow:

1. File Upload and Reading:

Recon files are uploaded by the bank to the designated S3 bucket.

The system monitors the S3 bucket for new files.

Once a file is detected, the system extracts the bank code from the file name.



2. Admin Service Call:

The extracted bank code is used to call the Admin Service.

Admin Service retrieves file configuration details from the RECON_FILE_CONFIG table in the Admin DB. These details include:

Bank ID

File Type

File Delimiter

Header Row Indicator

Data Read Starting Point

Encryption Status (if applicable)


If the file is encrypted, the configuration also includes the decryption key and the decryption method.



3. File Decryption (if required):

If the configuration indicates that the file is encrypted, the system proceeds to decrypt it.

The decryption key and method obtained from the Admin Service are used to perform decryption.

If the file is not encrypted, the system skips this step.



4. File Parsing:

Once decrypted (if needed), the file is parsed according to the configuration for that specific bank.

The parsing logic accounts for the file type, delimiter, header row, and data read starting point as specified in the config.

Extracted data includes essential details like Bank ID, Bank Hash, ATRN details, and transaction data.



5. Data Storage:

After successful parsing, the data is stored in the RECON_FILE_DTLS table in the Operations DB.

The data is sent to the DB in bundles using Kafka, which handles batch processing for efficiency.



6. Acknowledgment Generation:

Once data is successfully stored, an acknowledgment file is generated.

This file contains the status of the processing and is uploaded to the S3 bucket as confirmation.

Error Handling:

If file decryption fails, an error log is generated

Detailed Guide for Recon File Processing

Objective:

The purpose of this project is to automate the processing of reconciliation (Recon) files uploaded to an S3 bucket by various banks. The goal is to read, decrypt (if necessary), and parse these files, then store the parsed data in the Operations database (DB) using Kafka. Additionally, an acknowledgment file is generated in the S3 bucket after successful processing.


---

Functional Flow:

1. File Upload and Reading

Recon files are uploaded by the bank to a designated S3 bucket.

The system monitors the S3 bucket for new files using AWS S3 Event Notifications linked to an AWS Lambda function or a Spring Boot service that polls periodically.

Once a file is detected, the system extracts the bank code from the file name.


Implementation Steps:

1. S3 Configuration: Set up S3 bucket with Event Notifications (optional) or use AWS SDK in Spring Boot to poll the bucket.


2. File Detection Service:

Create a Spring Boot service with a scheduled task to poll the bucket.

Use the AmazonS3 client to list objects in the bucket.



3. Extract Bank Code:

Parse the file name to extract the bank code using regex or string operations.




Code Example:

@Autowired
private AmazonS3 amazonS3;

public List<String> listFiles(String bucketName) {
    ListObjectsV2Request req = new ListObjectsV2Request().withBucketName(bucketName);
    ListObjectsV2Result result = amazonS3.listObjectsV2(req);
    return result.getObjectSummaries().stream()
        .map(S3ObjectSummary::getKey)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}


---

2. Admin Service Call

Use the extracted bank code to call the Admin Service and fetch file configuration details from the RECON_FILE_CONFIG table in the Admin DB.


Implementation Steps:

1. Admin Service Endpoint:

Expose a REST API endpoint to fetch file configuration based on bank code.



2. Database Configuration:

Use JPA to map the RECON_FILE_CONFIG table.




Code Example:

@GetMapping("/config/{bankCode}")
public ReconFileConfig getConfig(@PathVariable String bankCode) {
    return reconFileConfigRepository.findByBankCode(bankCode);
}


---

3. File Decryption (if required)

If the configuration indicates encryption, proceed to decrypt the file using the key and method from the Admin Service.


Implementation Steps:

1. Encryption Algorithm Support:

Implement AES and RSA decryption as per the configuration.



2. Decryption Utility:

Create a utility class to perform decryption based on the encryption type.




Code Example:

public String decryptFile(byte[] encryptedData, String key) throws Exception {
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
    SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), "AES");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
    return new String(cipher.doFinal(encryptedData));
}


---

4. File Parsing

Once decrypted, parse the file according to the configuration details (file type, delimiter, header row, starting point).


Implementation Steps:

1. Parser Service:

Implement a service to read the file line by line, applying the correct delimiter.



2. Data Extraction:

Use the configuration details to extract necessary fields (Bank ID, Bank Hash, ATRN details, transaction data).




Code Example:

public List<String[]> parseFile(InputStream inputStream, String delimiter) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
    return reader.lines()
        .map(line -> line.split(delimiter))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}


---

5. Data Storage

After parsing, store the data in the RECON_FILE_DTLS table in the Operations DB.

Use Kafka for efficient batch processing and data transfer.


Implementation Steps:

1. Kafka Producer Configuration:

Configure Kafka Producer in Spring Boot.



2. Data Publishing:

Publish parsed data in bundles to the Kafka topic.



3. Database Insertion:

Implement a Kafka Consumer to read data from the topic and save it to the DB.




Code Example:

@KafkaListener(topics = "recon-data", groupId = "recon-group")
public void consume(String message) {
    ReconData data = new ObjectMapper().readValue(message, ReconData.class);
    reconDataRepository.save(data);
}


---

6. Acknowledgment Generation

After successful data storage, generate an acknowledgment file with processing details and status.

Upload this file to the S3 bucket as a confirmation.


Implementation Steps:

1. Acknowledgment Content:

Create a JSON or CSV file with status, bank code, and timestamp.



2. Upload to S3:

Use the putObject method from the AmazonS3 client to upload the acknowledgment file.




Code Example:

public void uploadAckFile(String bucketName, String fileName, String content) {
    amazonS3.putObject(bucketName, fileName, content);
}


---

Conclusion

The automated reconciliation file processing system streamlines file handling, decryption, parsing, data storage, and acknowledgment generation. Implementing the steps as outlined will ensure smooth and efficient processing of bank files, reducing manual workload and increasing accuracy.
