Detailed Guide for Recon File Processing

Objective:

The purpose of this project is to automate the processing of reconciliation (Recon) files uploaded to an S3 bucket by various banks. The goal is to read, decrypt (if necessary), and parse these files, then store the parsed data in the Operations database (DB) using Kafka. Additionally, an acknowledgment file is generated in the S3 bucket after successful processing.


---

Functional Flow:

1. File Upload and Reading

Recon files are uploaded by the bank to a designated S3 bucket.

The system monitors the S3 bucket for new files using AWS S3 Event Notifications linked to an AWS Lambda function or a Spring Boot service that polls periodically.

Once a file is detected, the system extracts the bank code from the file name.


Implementation Steps:

1. S3 Configuration: Set up S3 bucket with Event Notifications (optional) or use AWS SDK in Spring Boot to poll the bucket.


2. File Detection Service:

Create a Spring Boot service with a scheduled task to poll the bucket.

Use the AmazonS3 client to list objects in the bucket.



3. Extract Bank Code:

Parse the file name to extract the bank code using regex or string operations.




Code Example:

@Autowired
private AmazonS3 amazonS3;

public List<String> listFiles(String bucketName) {
    ListObjectsV2Request req = new ListObjectsV2Request().withBucketName(bucketName);
    ListObjectsV2Result result = amazonS3.listObjectsV2(req);
    return result.getObjectSummaries().stream()
        .map(S3ObjectSummary::getKey)
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}

2. Admin Service Call

Use the extracted bank code to call the Admin Service and fetch file configuration details from the RECON_FILE_CONFIG table in the Admin DB.


Implementation Steps:

1. Admin Service Endpoint:

Expose a REST API endpoint to fetch file configuration based on bank code.



2. Database Configuration:

Use JPA to map the RECON_FILE_CONFIG table.




Code Example:

@GetMapping("/config/{bankCode}")
public ReconFileConfig getConfig(@PathVariable String bankCode) {
    return reconFileConfigRepository.findByBankCode(bankCode);
}


---

3. File Decryption (if required)

If the configuration indicates encryption, proceed to decrypt the file using the key and method from the Admin Service.


Implementation Steps:

1. Encryption Algorithm Support:

Implement AES and RSA decryption as per the configuration.



2. Decryption Utility:

Create a utility class to perform decryption based on the encryption type.




Code Example:

public String decryptFile(byte[] encryptedData, String key) throws Exception {
    Cipher cipher = Cipher.getInstance("AES");
    SecretKeySpec secretKey = new SecretKeySpec(key.getBytes(), "AES");
    cipher.init(Cipher.DECRYPT_MODE, secretKey);
    return new String(cipher.doFinal(encryptedData));
}


---

4. File Parsing

Once decrypted, parse the file according to the configuration details (file type, delimiter, header row, starting point).


Implementation Steps:

1. Parser Service:

Implement a service to read the file line by line, applying the correct delimiter.



2. Data Extraction:

Use the configuration details to extract necessary fields (Bank ID, Bank Hash, ATRN details, transaction data).




Code Example:

public List<String[]> parseFile(InputStream inputStream, String delimiter) throws IOException {
    BufferedReader reader = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(inputStream));
    return reader.lines()
        .map(line -> line.split(delimiter))
        .collect(Collectors.toList());
}


---

5. Data Storage

After parsing, store the data in the RECON_FILE_DTLS table in the Operations DB.

Use Kafka for efficient batch processing and data transfer.


Implementation Steps:

1. Kafka Producer Configuration:

Configure Kafka Producer in Spring Boot.



2. Data Publishing:

Publish parsed data in bundles to the Kafka topic.



3. Database Insertion:

Implement a Kafka Consumer to read data from the topic and save it to the DB.




Code Example:

@KafkaListener(topics = "recon-data", groupId = "recon-group")
public void consume(String message) {
    ReconData data = new ObjectMapper().readValue(message, ReconData.class);
    reconDataRepository.save(data);
}


---

6. Acknowledgment Generation

After successful data storage, generate an acknowledgment file with processing details and status.

Upload this file to the S3 bucket as a confirmation.


Implementation Steps:

1. Acknowledgment Content:

Create a JSON or CSV file with status, bank code, and timestamp.



2. Upload to S3:

Use the putObject method from the AmazonS3 client to upload the acknowledgment file.




Code Example:

public void uploadAckFile(String bucketName, String fileName, String content) {
    amazonS3.putObject(bucketName, fileName, content);
}


---

Conclusion

The automated reconciliation file processing system streamlines file handling, decryption, parsing, data storage, and acknowledgment generation. Implementing the steps as outlined will ensure smooth and efficient processing of bank files, reducing manual workload and increasing accuracy.
