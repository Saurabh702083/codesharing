Above is my code that will generate the report based upon reportType and then update it into reportManagement table and then publish it .
now there is some additional condition has to be added. now two more Report type has to be added 
AAT_PAYOUT 

now when AAT_PAYOUT report type is called we have to pass payoutId as a filter to get the data. we have get the data from 
table MERCHANT_ACCOUNT_PAYOUT based upon payoutId and ifscCode starting with SBIN and then generate the .txt file as 
report and that txt file does not have header.

suppose we get the data from MERCHANT_ACCOUNT_PAYOUT in abow formate but in txt file that we generate we have to write in format like below 
1000310005ABC123XYZ123255066SBIN0000025430334464565
1000410006ABC456XYZ456255077SBIN0000012330334464515

it means we have to write full row in single line without any space and charater.

once the report is generated in .txt formate then as usale we have tore the file info in reportManagement and the publish into kafka
